:exclamation: This is work in progress! API is not stable and will change.

## ðŸ“‹ Example:

```C#

var webReaper = new Scraper("reddit")
    .WithStartUrl("https://www.reddit.com/r/dotnet/")
    .FollowLinks("a.SQnoC3ObvgnGjWt90zD9Z._2INHSNB8V5eaWp4P0rY_mE")
    .Parse(new Schema
    {
        new("title", "._eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"),
        new("text", "._3xX726aBn29LDbsDtzr_6E._1Ap4F5maDtT1E1YuCiaO0r.D3IL3FD0RFy_mkKLPwL4")
    })
    .WriteToJsonFile("output.json")
    .WithLogger(new ColorConsoleLogger())
    .Run(10);

Console.ReadLine();
```

## Features:

* :zap: It's extremly fast due to parallelism and asynchrony
* ðŸ—’ Declarative parsing with a structured scheme
* ðŸ’¾ Saving data to any sinks such as JSON or CSV file, MongoDB, CosmosDB, Redis, etc.
* :earth_americas: Distributed crawling support: run your web scraper on ony cloud VMs, serverless functions, on-prem servers, etc.

## API overview

### SPA parsing example

Parsing single page applications is super simple, just specify PageType.Dynamic. In this case Puppeteer will be used to load the pages.

```C#
var webReaper = new Scraper("reddit")
    .WithStartUrl("https://www.reddit.com/r/dotnet/", PageType.Dynamic)
    .FollowLinks("a.SQnoC3ObvgnGjWt90zD9Z._2INHSNB8V5eaWp4P0rY_mE", PageType.Dynamic)
    .Parse(new Schema
    {
        new("title", "._eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"),
        new("text", "._3xX726aBn29LDbsDtzr_6E._1Ap4F5maDtT1E1YuCiaO0r.D3IL3FD0RFy_mkKLPwL4")
    })
    .WriteToJsonFile("output.json")
    .WithLogger(new ColorConsoleLogger())
    .Run(10);

Console.ReadLine();
```

Additionaly, you can run any JavaScript on dynamic pages as they are loaded with headless browser. In order to do that you need to pass the third parameter:

```C#
var webReaper = new Scraper("reddit")
    .WithStartUrl("https://www.reddit.com/r/dotnet/", PageType.Dynamic, "window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);")
    .FollowLinks("a.SQnoC3ObvgnGjWt90zD9Z._2INHSNB8V5eaWp4P0rY_mE", PageType.Dynamic, "window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);")
    .Parse(new Schema
    {
        new("title", "._eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m"),
        new("text", "._3xX726aBn29LDbsDtzr_6E._1Ap4F5maDtT1E1YuCiaO0r.D3IL3FD0RFy_mkKLPwL4")
    })
    .WriteToJsonFile("output.json")
    .WithLogger(new ColorConsoleLogger())
    .Run(10);
```

It can be helpful if the required content is loaded only after some user interactions such as clicks, scrolls, etc.

### Authorization

If you need to pass authorization before parsing the web site, you can call Authorize method on Scraper that has to return CookieContainer with all cookies required for authorization. You are responsible for performing the login operation with your credentials, the Scraper only uses the cookies that you provide.

```C#
scraper = new Scraper()
    .WithLogger(logger)
    .WithStartUrl("https://rutracker.org/forum/index.php?c=33")
    .Authorize(() =>
    {
        var container = new CookieContainer();
        container.Add(new Cookie("AuthToken", "123");
        return container;
    })
```

### Distributed web scraping with Serverless approach

In the Examples folder you can find the project called WebReaper.AzureFuncs. It demonstrates the use of WebReaper with Azure Functions. It consists of two serverless functions:

#### StartScrapting
First of all, this function uses ScraperConfigBuilder to build the scraper configuration e. g.:

Secondly, this function writes the first web scraping job with startUrl to the Azure Service Bus queue:


#### WebReaperSpider

This Azure function is triggered by messages sent to the Azure Service Bus queue. Messages represent web scraping job. 

Firstly, this function builds the spider that is going to execute the job from the queue.

Secondly, it executes the job by loading the page, parsing content, saving to the database, etc.

Finally, it iterates through these new jobs and sends them the the Job queue.

### Extensibility

#### Adding a new sink to persist your data

Out of the box there are 4 sinks you can send your parsed data to: ConsoleSink, CsvFileSink, JsonFileSink, CosmosSink (Azure Cosmos database).

You can easly add your own by implementing the IScraperSink interface:

```C#
public interface IScraperSink
{
    public Task EmitAsync(JObject scrapedData);
}
```
Here is an example of the Console sink:

```C#
public class ConsoleSink : IScraperSink
{
    public Task EmitAsync(JObject scrapedData)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{scrapedData.ToString()}");
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```
The scrapedData parameter is JSON object that contains scraped data that you specified in your schema.

Adding your sink to the Scraper is simple, just call AddSink method on the Scraper:

```C#
scraper = new Scraper()
    .AddSink(new ConsoleSink());
    .WithStartUrl("https://rutracker.org/forum/index.php?c=33")
    .FollowLinks("#cf-33 .forumlink>a")
    .FollowLinks(".forumlink>a")
    .FollowLinks("a.torTopic", ".pg")
    .Parse(new Schema {
        new("name", "#topic-title"),
    });
```

For other ways to extend your functionality see the next section.
